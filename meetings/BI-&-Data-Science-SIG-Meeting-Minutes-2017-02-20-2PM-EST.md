***Minutes***
-	Introduction from all attendees
-	Overview of the background of SIG
-	Sharing the expectation of the SIG from attendees
-	There are multiple solutions in Data Science and hard to provide one single solution.
-	The 2 tools being discussed extensively in the call are Jupyter (On the cluster or not), Zeppelin
-	Discussion on benchmarking to evaluate the effectiveness of BI/Data Science
 -	Need a way to quantify the benchmark
 -	Need to find ways to claim ODPi compliant. But for now, most of the cases are feature compliant, not Benchmark compliant. 
 -	TPC-DS has already developed and used by vendors for benchmarking SQL
 -	Benchmarking on Data Science notebook is a very a new field and may lead to too much work to be completed within the first deliverable timeframe
-	Best practices and standard on how to hook all things up
 -	Not to tell what is the right tool but how to connect them. Examples include
  -	How to set up Zeppelin on Spark?
  -	How to configure Jupyter?
  -	What is the best way to connect MicroStrategy to Hive and then how to tune Hive for better performance?
  -	How data science be related to visualization and show how an algorithm run in real time?
-	Agreement on first deliverable
 -	Standardize a guideline for vendor so that they know how to put up a data science notebook
 -	Strengths and Weaknesses comparison
 -	Recommendation of when to use what 
 -	So far, we have only 2 tools for comparison: Jupyter and Zeppelin
-	Communication 
 -	Most communication will be done by email
 -	Concern about using ODPi listserv (odpi-technical@lists.odpi.org) as the email for this SIG will hide some real communication this group should be aware of. 
 -	Minimize conference call meeting due to busy schedule of the members and hard to come up with a common time across different time zones
-	Action item
 -	Tanping will share what IBM is currently doing regarding to Notebook best practice
 -	Cupid will follow up with Roman and John for having our own email alias.
