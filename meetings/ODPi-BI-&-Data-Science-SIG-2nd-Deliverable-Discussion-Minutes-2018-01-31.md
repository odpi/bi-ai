- Format of the next deliverable
	- Collaborate by this group like what we have done in the first release of “Data Science Notebook Guideline” (http://bit.ly/2hJRi8v?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3BubQNgjXjS%2BOQ0ra5nt%2FTOw%3D%3D)
	- Send question(s) to vendor to solicit response
	- Long list of question VS one question at a time. The group agrees a smaller set of question works better
- Content of the next deliverable
	- Comparison of different BI/SQL Connector including Hive, Presto, Impala… etc 
	- Best practice for BI tool to connect to both Hadoop and RDBMS
	- Recommended BI architecture to query Hadoop
	- How does BI running advanced analytics including Machine Learning algorithm on Hadoop?
	- Others?
- Qlik mentioned that their Technical Marketing team may be a better participant in this group, instead of Partner Engineering team

**Next Step**
- confirm the question to be used to send to the vendor
- collect a list of potential BI vendors for the questions
- LF marketing team will check the first release statistics and share if we have received any feedback
